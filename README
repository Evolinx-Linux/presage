Welcome to Soothsayer, the intelligent extensible pluggable
predictive text entry system.


This document will guide you through the steps required to configure
and build the Soothsayer system and libraries. You should be ready to
run Soothsayer in a few minutes.

This README does not contain the answers to all the questions you
might have. If you run into troubles, if you have problems, or if you
would like a pressing question answered, please direct your attention
to the doc/ directory, where you will find all the available
documentation.


Requirements:
- A working development enviroment.
  On Linux/Unix systems, this means having GCC, the GNU Compiler
  Collection packages, as well as libraries for these languages
  (libstdc++, libgcj, glibc, etc).
  On Windows systems, please install the Cygwin development
  environment. Cygwin can be obtained from http://www.cygwin.com
  Instructions on how to setup Cygwin and the required packages can be
  found in the INSTALL_cygwin_dev_env.txt

- SQLite package. SQLite is a small C library that implements a
  self-contained, embeddable, zero-configuration SQL database engine.
  SQLite can be obtained from http://www.sqlite.org
