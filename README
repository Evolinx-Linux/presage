Welcome to Presage, the intelligent extensible pluggable predictive
text entry system.


This document will guide you through the steps required to configure
and build the Presage system and libraries. You should be ready to run
Presage in a few minutes.

This README does not contain the answers to all the questions you
might have. If you run into troubles, if you have problems, or if you
would like a pressing question answered, please direct your attention
to the doc/ directory, where you will find all the available
documentation.


Requirements:
- A working development enviroment.
  On Linux/Unix systems, this means having GCC (g++), the GNU Compiler
  Collection packages, as well as libraries for these languages
  (libstdc++, glibc, etc).

  On Solaris systems, this means having Sun Studio 10 or Sun Studio 11
  compilers.

  On Windows systems, please either install the Cygwin development
  environment or the MinGW/MSYS developer environment.

  Cygwin can be obtained from http://www.cygwin.com
  Instructions on how to setup Cygwin and required packages can be
  found in the doc/INSTALL_Cygwin_dev_env.txt file.

  MinGW/MSYS can be obtained from http://www.mingw.org
  Instructions on how to setup MinGW/MSYS and required packages can be
  found in the doc/INSTALL_MinGW_MSYS_dev_env.txt file.

- SQLite package. SQLite is a small C library that implements a
  self-contained, embeddable, zero-configuration SQL database engine.
  SQLite can be obtained from http://www.sqlite.org

STEP 0: Getting Presage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Official releases and development snapshots are available from the
download section of the official website hosted by SourceForge

  http://presage.sourceforge.net

Alternatively, get the latest and greatest sources from SVN.


_________________________
STEP 1: Unpacking Presage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Linux/Unix, uncompress and untar the distribution with 

  tar jxvf presage-*.tar.bz2

or

  tar zxvf presage-*.tar.gz

depending on whether you downloaded the tarball or the bzipped archive.


___________________________
STEP 2: Configuring Presage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring Presage to different platforms, environments and
operating systems is simply a matter of running

  ./configure

in the top-level directory of the distribution. This will configure
Presage for your system. Should you require additional options, try

  ./configure --help

to see the available options.


_________________________
STEP 3: Compiling Presage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kick off the compilation with

  make

This will build the Presage system, libraries and available
plugins.


__________________________
STEP 4: Installing Presage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Presage and its support libraries and plugins by typing

  make install


__________________________________
STEP 5: Let Presage read your mind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Presage includes a little demonstration program that will read the
user input and guess what the user intends to type using its
predictive technology. To start it, type

  presage_demo

or

  presage_demo_text
