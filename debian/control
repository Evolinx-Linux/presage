Description: The intelligent predictive text entry platform
 Soothsayer is an intelligent predictive text entry
 platform. Soothsayer exploits redundant information embedded in
 natural languages to generate predictions. Soothsayer's modular and
 pluggable architecture allows its language model to be extended and
 customized to utilize statistical, syntactic, and semantic information
 sources.
 .
 This package contains the tools required to generate custom
 statistical data used by soothsayer to generate predictions.
 .
 This package also contains simple demonstration programs.
