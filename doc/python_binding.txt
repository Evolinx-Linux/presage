Soothsayer Python binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Python binding for Soothsayer can optionally be built configuring
the build system is with the --enable-python-binding flag.

The Python binding is a Python extension module that wraps around the
soothsayer library (libsoothsayer.so). The Python extension module is
built using SWIG and the Python Distribution Utilities package
(distutils).


To use the Python binding for soothsayer

1) Ensure that the Python extension module is built by configuring in
   the optional python binding:

   ./configure --enable-python-binding


2) Build and install as usual
   
   make
   make install


3) An additional _soothsayer library will have been built and
   installed into your system Python extension library directory. This
   is the soothsayer Python extension module.


4) You should now be able to use Soothsayer from Python. Read through
   the runme.py from the bindings/python directory script for an
   example and try running it with:

   python runme.py /path/to/soothsayer.xml



A few points to note if you installed in a non-default location:

- the Python extension module _soothsayer.so (_soothsayer.dll) depends
  on libsoothsayer.so (libsoothsayer.dll), so ensure that it is on the
  runtime loader path (i.e. LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux/Solaris, LIBPATH
  on AIX, PATH on Windows, etc.)

- the Python extension module _soothsayer.so needs to be in a standard
  Python extension library directory in order for Python to find it,
  or the directory containing the extension module needs to be added
  to the PYTHONPATH environment variable
