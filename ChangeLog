2007-04-29  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/tools: removed unneeded database.h, database.cpp,
	sqlite.cpp, fileTokenizer.h, fileTokenizer.cpp

2007-04-27  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* updated_email_address: in all .h and .cpp files, courtesy of the
	all powerful find and sed utils - i.e. `find . -name "*.h" -type f
	-exec sed -i -e
	's/matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk/matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk/' {} \;'
	
2007-04-26  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* tools: retired old text2unigram, text2bigram, text2trigram,
	text2unigramdb, text2bigramdb, text2trigramdb tools, which are
	superseded by text2ngram tool.

2007-04-23  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* logging: added LOG() macro to turn log messages on/off in
	tools/dbConnectors. This is a temporary solution using
	preprocessor macros, which should be replaced by an appropriate
	logger implementation.

2007-04-16  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/plugins/smoothedUniBiTriGramPlugin: modified plugin to use new
	databaseConnector classes

	* src/tools/sqliteDatabaseConnector: added ORDER BY clause to
	getNgramLikeTable() method

2007-04-15  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* resources: switched database creation to new text2ngram tool,
	which uses the new table names in _N_gram form.
	
2007-04-12  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/tools/sqliteDatabaseConnector: fixed callback() method by
	return 0 to signal normal execution. Oddly, even the the method
	signature specifies an integer return type, the gcc C++ compiler
	does not generate any error or warning that no value is returned.

2007-03-30  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* test/tools/databaseConnectorTest: added tests for
	...NgramLikeTable() methods family, fixed tests to account for
	buildXClause changes

	* test/tools/sqliteDatabaseConnectorTest: fixed tests to account
	for buildXClause changes
	
2007-03-25  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/tools/databaseConnector: fixed bugs affecting the
	buildXClause family of functions

2007-03-23  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/tools/databaseConnector: added getNgramLikeTable() method,
	which returns a set of ngrams that are possible completions of the
	supplied ngram

	* src/tools/databaseConnector: changed executeSql() to return an
	NgramTable instead of a string to ease subsequent manipulation and
	information extraction
	
2007-03-03  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/tools/tokenizer: renamed Tokenizer class to FileTokenizer,
	taking us one step closer to fully removing code duplication with
	src/core/tokenizer classes... :-)

	* src/tools/utility: removed duplicate code from strtolower
	functions family
	
	* src/Makefile.am: linking libtools.la with libsoothsayer.la

2007-02-24  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* text2ngram: added -o option (set output file) and option -f (set
	file format), text2ngram can output in text file or sqlite format

	* progress.h: turned progress bar implementation into a class,
	added progress bar completion on object destruction

2007-02-19  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* profileManager: when no profile is found, use default value for
	configuration parameters

2007-02-16  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* headers: changed generation of multiple headers containing
	directory value to single header

	* profileManager: default profile is loaded from system-wide and
	installation specific paths

	* smoothedUniBiTrigramPlugin: database is found based on
	installation location

2007-02-02  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* headers: added generation of headers with defines for
	sysconfdir, datadir, pkgdatadir, and localstatedir using built
	sources

2007-01-18  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* svn: moved soothsayer codebase to subversion

	* plugins: plugins subsystem was temporarily disabled, now
	smoothed uni/bi/trigram plugin is linked into soothsayer library

	* birthday: born on this day a few years ago
	
	* promise: I will start updating the changelog frequently
