	configuration pulling refactor. Plugins and components now query a
	Profile object, created by ProfileManager, and pull the values of
	the configuration variables they need from it, rather than having
	ProfileManager push the configuration out towards plugins and
	components.

	rebuilt after package reconfiguration.

2007-06-25  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/tools/sqliteDatabaseConnector: fixed exceptions raised when

	tests.

	* src/plugins/smoothedUniBiTrigramPluginTest: fixed bug exposed by
	new plugin unit tests.

2007-06-22  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am: minor changes and cleanups.

2007-06-13  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	config file from template and determine cygwin root directory,
	when on cygwin, to work around sqlite problem with absolute
	database paths on Windows+Cygwin

2007-06-04  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

2007-05-11  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/core/historyTracker: fixed bug in getToken(index), incorrect
	token was returned when index pointed too far back into the
	history.

	* src/tools/databaseConnector: fixed bug in the query generation
	code. A keyword in single quotes is interpreted as a literal
	string if it occurs in a context where a string literal is
	allowed, otherwise it is understood as an identifier, whereas a
	keyword in double-quotes is interpreted as an identifier if it
	matches a known identifier - otherwise it is interpreted as a
	string literal. The following WHERE word = "word" is a no-op, the
	correct clause is WHERE word = 'word'.

2007-05-10  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/soothsayerDemo: added function key sidebar.

2007-05-09  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	all powerful find and sed utils - i.e. `find . -name "*.h" -type f
	-exec sed -i -e
	's/matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk/matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk/' {} \;'
	
2007-04-26  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

2007-03-30  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* test/tools/databaseConnectorTest: added tests for
	...NgramLikeTable() methods family, fixed tests to account for

	which returns a set of ngrams that are possible completions of the

	information extraction
	
2007-03-03  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/tools/tokenizer: renamed Tokenizer class to FileTokenizer,

	file format), text2ngram can output in text file or sqlite format

	* progress.h: turned progress bar implementation into a class,
	added progress bar completion on object destruction

2007-02-19  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* profileManager: when no profile is found, use default value for
	configuration parameters

2007-02-16  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* headers: changed generation of multiple headers containing
	directory value to single header

	* profileManager: default profile is loaded from system-wide and
	installation specific paths

	* smoothedUniBiTrigramPlugin: database is found based on
	installation location

2007-02-02  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* headers: added generation of headers with defines for
	sysconfdir, datadir, pkgdatadir, and localstatedir using built
	sources

2007-01-18  Matteo Vescovi  <matteo.vescovi@yahoo.co.uk>

	* svn: moved soothsayer codebase to subversion

	* plugins: plugins subsystem was temporarily disabled, now
	smoothed uni/bi/trigram plugin is linked into soothsayer library

	* birthday: born on this day a few years ago
