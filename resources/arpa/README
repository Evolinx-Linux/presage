The scripts in this directory are used to generate the ARPA language
model resources.

The bnc.arpa / bnc.vocab language model was generated from the British
National Corpus (BNC). 

The British National Corpus (BNC) is a 100 million word collection of
samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources,
designed to represent a wide cross-section of current British English,
both spoken and written.
http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/

The generated language model contains 20.001 unigrams, 517.537
bigrams, and 1.648.226 trigrams. This language model was constructed
by computing the smoothed Katz backoff trigram model using the
CMU-Cambridge Statistical Language Modeling toolkit by running the
scripts provided in this directory.


Requirements:
- BNC texts are in the 'Texts' subdirectory (maintaining the original
  subfolder structure)
- BNC XSL scripts in are the 'Scripts' subdirectory
- the program 'xslproc' is installed
- CMU SLM Toolkit is installed


Steps to create the language model starting from the BNC:
1) run the script 'convcorpus' to convert the texts from XML to plain txt
2) run the script 'corpuscats' to extract the categories associated to each text
3) run the script 'subcorpus' to extract all the texts associated to a specific set of categories (corpus partition)
4) run the script 'mergesubcorpus' to create a single txt file from a collection of texts (corpus partition)
5) run the script 'createlm' to create the LM starting from the single text file created
