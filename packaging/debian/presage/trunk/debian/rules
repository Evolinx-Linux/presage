# workaround issue whereby CDBS cleans out autotools before cleaning
# out distutils. This results in make distclean running before python
# setup.py clean --all. Because setup.py is generated by configure, it
# will be removed by make distclean before python setup.py clean gets
# a chance to run. Hence, the python build/ directory is left over.
#
# Adding a clean target here to remove it explicitly.
