Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
	 ${misc:Depends},
	 libpresage-data (= ${source:Version})
Description: intelligent predictive text entry platform (shared library)
 Presage is an intelligent predictive text entry platform.
 .
 A predictive text entry system attempts to improve the ease and speed
 of textual input by predicting words. Word prediction consists in
 computing which word tokens or word completions are most likely to be
 entered next. The system analyses the text already entered and
 combines the information thus extracted with other information sources
 to calculate the set of most probable tokens.
 .
 Presage exploits redundant information embedded in natural
 languages to generate word predictions. The modular architecture
 allows its language model to be extended and customized to utilize
 statistical, syntactic, and semantic information sources.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
